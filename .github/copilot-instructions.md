# WhatsApp Desktop Client for Linux (unofficial)

## Overview

This is an unofficial WhatsApp Desktop Client for Linux, built using Electron and React. It provides a native-like experience for WhatsApp on Linux systems. The application is designed to be lightweight and fast, while still providing all the features of the official WhatsApp web client.

## Development Guidelines

1. Always maintain TypeScript type safety
2. Follow the established project structure
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Ensure consistent code formatting
5. Write clean, maintainable code with proper comments
6. Follow the existing naming conventions
7. Use yarn for package management (e.g., `yarn add` instead of `npm install`)
8. Always scan for and fix any errors in a file after making changes before moving on to other tasks
9. When working on multiple files, completely resolve all errors and issues in the current file before proceeding to other files
10. Use Git for version control and follow best practices
11. Only create new files when explicitly requested by the user or when absolutely necessary for implementing requested features
12. Do not create additional files or write code that hasn't been specifically requested
13. Before creating any new file:
    - Verify that the file creation is part of the user's explicit request
    - Check if the functionality can be implemented using existing files
    - Get user confirmation if there's any ambiguity about file creation
14. Follow the existing directory structure when creating new files
